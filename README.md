# Prerequisites

Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher). You can download it from nodejs.org.

# 1. Clone the repository to your IDE and install dependencies 

In the terminal run:

`git clone https://github.com/alexiacooze/weather-app-client`

`cd weather-app`

`npm install`


# Start React app in Browser

In the terminal run
`npm start`

You will see the following output within the terminal:

`Compiled successfully!`

`You can now view weather-app in the browser.`

  `Local:            http://localhost:3001`

`webpack compiled successfully`
`No issues found.`

App must run on port 3001, as Apollo CORS server is configured to accept `http://localhost:3001`
Open `http://localhost:3001` to view it in the browser.
